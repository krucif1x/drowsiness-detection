    This function performs the following operations on each frame:
    1. Captures a video frame from the camera.
    2. Detects multi-face landmarks using a drowsiness detection model.
    3. Detects hand landmarks and body pose.
    4. Identifies if the user is making a phone call based on body pose.
    5. Estimates head pose (yaw, pitch, roll) and draws corresponding annotations.
    6. Checks for drowsiness and yawning based on eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth aspect ratio (MAR).
    7. Draws annotations for detected landmarks (eyes, mouth, hands).
    8. Encodes the processed frame as a JPEG image for streaming.

    The resulting frames are yielded as a stream for real-time display or transmission.
