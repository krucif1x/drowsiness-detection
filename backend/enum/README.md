Enum is short for enumeration

Enum is a method use to create a set of symbolic names (members) that are bound to unique,
constant values

enum = 'custom data type for a fixed set of constants'

Its purpose is to make your code more readbale and less error-prone by replacing "magic numbers"
or strings with meaningful names

Magic Numbers are hardcoded numbers with unexplained meaning that are considered bad practice

Ex. usage of ENUM

2 represents a phone call alert
Through ENUM, it can be DriverActivities.ALERT_DRIVER_MAKE_PHONE_CALL_WHILE_DRIVING
