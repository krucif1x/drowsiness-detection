class DetectionBackgroundService:
    """
    A service that manages the background execution of the detection task 
    in a separate thread. It coordinates real-time monitoring of driver behavior,
    including drowsiness, phone usage, and hand gestures, using camera input 
    and machine learning models.

    This class serves as a controller that handles starting, pausing, resuming, 
    and stopping the detection loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detection_task : DetectionTask
        The task object that contains the core detection loop to be executed.
    drowsiness_service : DrowsinessDetectionService
        Service for detecting signs of driver drowsiness.
    phone_detection_service : PhoneDetectionService
        Service for detecting phone usage while driving.
    hand_service : HandsDetectionService
        Service for detecting hand presence, position, or gestures.
    camera : BaseCamera
        Camera interface used to capture video frames in real-time.
    frame_buffer : FrameBuffer
        Buffer that holds the latest raw and processed frames for use by other components.
